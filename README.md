# DSS5105 Assignment 2 â€“ Flask ATE Model API

This project implements a Flask web application that fits a linear regression model to estimate the **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** using observational data. The app exposes two endpoints:

- `/ate`: Returns model coefficients (Î±, Ï„, Î²) and the statistical significance of the treatment effect.
- `/predict`: Returns the predicted engagement score for given treatment and sustainability spending inputs.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Specification

The linear model is defined as:

```
Y = Î± + Ï„Â·W + Î²Â·X + Îµ
```

Where:
- `Y` = Engagement Score  
- `W` = Treatment (0 or 1)  
- `X` = Sustainability Spending  
- `Î±` = Intercept  
- `Ï„` = Average Treatment Effect (ATE)  
- `Î²` = Effect of sustainability spending  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

Server will start on: `http://localhost:5000`

## ðŸ”Œ API Endpoints

### `/predict` â€“ Predict engagement score

**Usage:**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/predict?w=1&x=25.0"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "Input": {"W": 1.0, "X": 25.0},
  "Predicted Engagement Score": 124.73
}
```

### `/ate` â€“ View model coefficients and ATE significance

**Usage:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/ate
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "ATE (tau)": -9.1057,
  "ATE (tau) p-value": 0.0004,
  "Interpretation": "Statistically significant",
  "alpha (Intercept)": 95.9662,
  "beta (Sustainability Spending effect)": 1.5149
}
```
